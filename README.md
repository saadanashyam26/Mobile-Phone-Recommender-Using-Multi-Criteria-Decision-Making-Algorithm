# üì± Mobile Phone Recommender Using Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Algorithm

## üìå Project Overview

With the vast number of smartphones available in the market, selecting the right one can be overwhelming. This project introduces an **AI-powered mobile phone recommender system** that helps users choose the best smartphone based on **Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) algorithms**.

The system ranks smartphones based on **user-defined criteria**, such as **price, camera, RAM, ROM, brand, and OS**. It utilizes **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for weight assignment** and **PROMETHEE 1 & 2, TOPSIS** for ranking recommendations efficiently.

## üéØ Objectives

- Develop a **mobile phone recommender system** based on user preferences.
- Implement **MCDM algorithms (AHP, PROMETHEE, TOPSIS)** for optimal recommendations.
- Provide an **interactive web interface** for users to filter and prioritize attributes.
- Compare **algorithm efficiency** in terms of **time and space complexity**.
- Ensure users **stay focused** on their original intent without distractions.

## üìÇ System Workflow

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **User Input & Filters**
- Users enter preferences: **price, camera, RAM, ROM, OS, brand, etc.**
- Assign weightage to each criterion.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **AHP Algorithm Processing**
- Weights are assigned based on user priorities.
- **Hierarchical ranking** of smartphone attributes.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **PROMETHEE & TOPSIS Ranking**
- **PROMETHEE 1 & 2 algorithms** rank smartphones using user-defined weights.
- **TOPSIS method** refines results by evaluating **ideal and worst-case solutions**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Recommendation Display**
- The system presents a **ranked list of smartphones**.
- Users receive **service provider suggestions** for their selected phone.
